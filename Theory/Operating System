Operating System:

1. What is the main purpose of an operating system? Discuss different types?

Main Purposes::

Convinience: Interface between user and hardware for managing the hardware/resources
Throughput: Increase the output. Number of prcesses by unit time. (does this by resource mgmt and process mgmt[cpu scheduling])
Storage mgmt: Through file system [for harddisk]
Memory mgmt: [for RAM] because ram is limited. OS does ram swapping
Security and privacy: No everyone can access the OS.You have to login first. Makes processes secure(security between processes)

Linux has more throughput than windows

Types::

Real time: No delays. Missile system or flight systems
Distributed: Processing environment is dispersed      connected with network.
Clustered: Multiple devices added to one network. Fault tolerence. Scalibility.
Embedded OS: in washing machine etc. instructions are embedded


Flow diagram of our PC: User-->Applications-->OS(Serves via system calls to hardware)-->Hardware

2. What is a socket, kernel and monolithic kernel ?

Sockets are strategy used for communication in client server system. It is the end point for communication
Socket is identified with IP address and port number.

Sockets are used to establish connection.It is kind of the opening list your electric socket.

These servers listens to these ports
Tenet port 23(remote login)
ftp 21 http 80
Ports below 1024 are reserved for standard services therefore use ports above 1024
